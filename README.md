Milestone Three Project: Data Centric Development - Code Institute

## Project Purpose
This a MongoDB-backed Flask project that showcases the best locations for real estate investing all over the world, recommended & reviewed by real users who are involved & interested in real estate investing at home & abroad.
Users can add new locations they recommend by signing up or logging in to their account & they can look at everyone elses investing location recommendations. They can also edit their own recommendations to update the information & they can delete their recommendation if they aren't happy with it.
Other users can then review the locations recommended by upvoting/downvoting the records & by leaving comments of their own opinions of the location.

### Target Audience
This site aims to provide valuable information to real estate investors looking for a good location to invest in.

It informs site visitors about the best locations to invest in through real estate. All locations are recommended & reviewed by other investors. They add new locations to the site recommending where to invest to others.

The main objective of the site is to provide the site visitor & user with a valuable database of locations to invest in, where the locations are recommended by users who have accounts with the site & then reviewed by others to create a great valuable community of real estate investors giving their opinions.

### Strategy
- My aim is to create a valuable database of real estate investing locations that are recommended & reviewed by real investors.
- The site is for both those involved & interested in real estate investing and for them to find their perfect location to invest in.

### Scope
For site visitors - I want them to be able to use the site to find interesting locations to invest in real estate in and review others recommendations, to use the site to add their own recommended locations, to update and edit them recommendations to change the information they provided, and to delete their recommendation if they would like.

### Structure

### Skeleton
